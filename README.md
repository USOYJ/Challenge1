# Code Refactor Starter Code
<h1>challenge1 Semantics and Accessiblility assignment</h1>

# This project we were required to change codes in an already working web page to follow HTML semantics and w3c web accessiblity rules
# four major principles for an accessible website are:
<ul>
<li> It has to be perceivable</li>
<li> It has to be operable</li>
<li> It has to be understandable</li>
<li> It has to be robust</li>
</ul>
I followed these principles and used the right HTML semantics

To review this project you use screen reader; for windows user you can go <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org/">NV Access</a> to download the NVDA accessible screen reader and for the MAC simply  tap the command key+F5 for the VoiceOver screen reader
I was able to understand and fix this code with the help of couple of these websites <a href="https://learntheweb.courses/topics/html-semantics-cheat-sheet"> html-semantics-cheat-sheet</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/"> W3C WAI</a> 
You can also decide to inspect the project by right clicking on the page to see the elements that used.
Thank you!
