# Code Refactor Starter Code
<h1>challenge1 Semantics and Accessiblility assignment</h1>

# On this project we were required to change codes in an already working web page to follow HTML semantics and w3c web accessiblity rules
# four major principles for an accessible website are:
<ul>
<li> It has to be perceivable</li>
<li> It has to be operable</li>
<li> It has to be understandable</li>
<li> It has to be robust</li>
</ul>
<p>I followed these principles and used the right HTML semantics</p>

<p>To review this project you can use screen readers;</p> 
<p>for windows user you can go <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org/">NV Access</a> to download the NVDA accessible screen reader</p>
<p>for MacBook users simply  tap the command key+F5 for the VoiceOver screen reader</p>
<p>I was able to understand and fix this code with the help of couple of these websites:</p> 
<a href="https://learntheweb.courses/topics/html-semantics-cheat-sheet"> html-semantics-cheat-sheet</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/"> W3C WAI</a> 
<p>You can also decide to inspect the project by right clicking on the page to see the elements that used.</p>
Thank you!
